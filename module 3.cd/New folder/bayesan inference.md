What is an Estimate?
An estimate is an educated guess or approximation of a value based on limited information.
Why Do We Use Estimates?
Estimates help us:

Make decisions quickly when we don’t have exact data

Plan ahead for resources, time, or money

Handle uncertainty in real-world situations
Where Do We Use Estimates?
Estimating mean or standard deviation from a sample

Estimating model accuracy before full deployment

Estimating unknown values (like future sales, prices)
| Reason            | Why It Matters                                    |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ Planning        | Helps manage time, cost, and effort               |
| ✅ Risk Reduction  | Gives an idea of uncertainty or possible errors   |
| ✅ Decision-Making | Supports smart choices when data is incomplete    |
| ✅ Communication   | Gives teams and clients expectations to work with |

What is Bayesian Inference?
Bayesian inference is a way of updating what we believe based on new evidence.

It uses Bayes' Theorem to combine
:

What we already believe (prior knowledge)

With new data or observations (evidence)

To get a better belief (posterior probability)
