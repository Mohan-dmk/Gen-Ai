what is a data science?
Data Science is an interdisciplinary field that uses techniques from statistics, computer science, and domain expertise to collect, clean, analyze, visualize, and model data to discover patterns, generate insights, and support decision-making or automation.

| 1. **Problem Understanding**  | Know what problem you are solving (e.g., predict sales, detect fraud).             |
| 2. **Data Collection**        | Gather data from sources like files, databases, or APIs.                           |
| 3. **Data Cleaning**          | Fix or remove incorrect, missing, or duplicate data.                               |
| 4. **Data Exploration (EDA)** | Analyze data with charts, graphs, and summary statistics to find patterns.         |
| 5. **Feature Engineering**    | Create new columns or select important ones to improve model performance.          |
| 6. **Model Building**         | Use machine learning algorithms (like Decision Trees or BERT) to make predictions. |
| 7. **Model Evaluation**       | Test how well the model works using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, etc. |
| 8. **Deployment**             | Make the model available for real use (e.g., via web app or API).                  |
| 9. **Monitoring**             | Track the modelâ€™s performance over time and improve it when needed.                |
