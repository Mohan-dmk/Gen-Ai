What is a Cluster?
A cluster is a group of similar data points that are closer to each other than to points in other groups.
 Think of it like putting similar things into the same box — apples with apples, oranges with oranges — without being told what is what.
 In Machine Learning:
Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique.

It means the algorithm tries to find patterns or groups in the data without any labels.

The algorithm looks at data points and says:
“These seem to behave similarly — I’ll group them together.”
Key Concepts in Clustering
✅ 1. Cluster
A set of similar items grouped together.

✅ 2. Centroid (K-Means only)
The center of a cluster. All points in that cluster are closer to it than to others.

✅ 3. Distance
Used to measure similarity. Points closer = more similar.

✅ 4. Noise / Outliers
Points that don’t belong to any cluster (especially in DBSCAN). May indicate anomalies or errors.
