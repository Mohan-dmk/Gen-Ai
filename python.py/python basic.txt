1)

what is a program ?

program is a set of instruction in programing language that tells the computer to what to do 
Takes input (e.g., user data, files, sensors)

Processes that input (e.g., calculations, logic, decisions)

Produces output (e.g., a result on screen, a file, or action)

2)
Why is python is useful than other languages we have?

Python is a easy to read write and it has huge collections of libraries so we dont have write everything .

3)
what is a package?

 A package is a folder that contains multiple related Python files (called modules).Each module has different code written for a specific task.A package helps us organize code, reuse it, and share it easily with others. Instead of writing everything from scratch, we can just import a package and use the tools inside it.

Different of types of packages we have pandas, scikit-learn, flask, requests, NumPy, matplotlib and we use key word "import" to use this package.

4)
what is a flow chart?

A flowchart is a visual diagram that shows the steps in a process or program, using shapes and arrows to represent the flow of logic.
A oval it represent the start and end
Process (Rectangle)	A task or action to perform
Decision (Diamond)	A yes/no or true/false condition
Arrow	Direction of flow (next step)
 Input/Output (Parallelogram)	Get input or display result

5) what is a Operator?
Operators are special symbols or words that perform operations on variables or values, like math, comparison, logic, etc.
we have different types of operators like Arithmetic Operators – Do basic math,Comparison Operators(like ==, !=, <,>), Logical Operators (like and or and not)

6) what is loop?

A loop is a way to repeat a set of instructions again and again until a condition is met.

Main we have like for loop, while loop, for each

For loop:
✅ What it does:
Repeats a block of code a specific number of times or for each item in a list.
for i in range(1, 6):
    print("Count:", i)

while loop :
✅ What it does:
Repeats while a condition is true. You must control the condition to stop the loop.

count = 1
while count <= 5:
    print("This is number", count)
    count += 1
Starts from count = 1

Repeats until count becomes 6

Make sure to update the counter (count += 1) or it loops forever!

7) Function ?
A function is a named block of code that performs a specific task. You can call it whenever you want to perform that task again.

def function name(parameters)
    # code block
    return result
8) what is a parameter?
A parameter is a variable listed inside the parentheses when you define a function. It acts as a placeholder for the actual value (called an argument) that you pass into the function when you call it.
9) what is a argument?

An argument is the actual value you pass into a function when you call it. It gets assigned to the function's parameter.
 Types of arguments:
	Positional Arguments – matched by position
        Keyword Arguments – matched by name
        Default Arguments – used if no value is given
        Variable-length Arguments:
       *args for multiple positional arguments
 Quick Summary:
Parameters define what kind of input a function expects.

Arguments are the actual data you provide when you use the function.

10) What is a Data structure?
A data structure is a special way of organizing and storing data so that it can be used efficiently.

we have different types of data structure List, Tuple, Set , Dictionary
 1. List
✅ Description:
Ordered

Changeable (mutable)

Allows duplicate values

🔹 Example:
python
Copy
Edit
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(fruits[1])       # Output: banana
fruits.append("mango") # Adds a new item
print(fruits)          # Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'mango']
Use Case:
When you need to store a sequence of items and may want to add/remove/change them.
2. Tuple
✅ Description:
Ordered

Unchangeable (immutable)

Allows duplicate values

🔹 Example:
python
Copy
Edit
coordinates = (10, 20)
print(coordinates[0])  # Output: 10
# coordinates[0] = 15  # ❌ Error: Tuple is immutable
Use Case:
When you want to store data that shouldn't change, like coordinates or configuration settings.
3. Set
✅ Description:
Unordered

No duplicate values

Changeable

🔹 Example:
python
Copy
Edit
unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 2, 1}
print(unique_numbers)   # Output: {1, 2, 3}
unique_numbers.add(4)   # Adds a new value
print(unique_numbers)   # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4}
Use Case:
When you want to store unique items and don’t care about order (e.g., tags, keywords).
 4. Dictionary
✅ Description:
Key-value pairs

Unordered (before Python 3.7), now insertion-ordered

Fast lookup by key

🔹 Example:
python
Copy
Edit
student = {"name": "Mohan", "age": 20, "grade": "A"}
print(student["name"])      # Output: Mohan
student["age"] = 21         # Update age
print(student)              # {'name': 'Mohan', 'age': 21, 'grade': 'A'}
 Use Case:
When you want to map one value to another (like a name to an age, or a word to a definition).
