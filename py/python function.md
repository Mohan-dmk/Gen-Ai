what is a program ?

program is a set of instruction in programing language that tells the computer to what to do 
Takes input (e.g., user data, files, sensors)

Processes that input (e.g., calculations, logic, decisions)

Produces output (e.g., a result on screen, a file, or action)

2)
Why is python is useful than other languages we have?

Python is a easy to read write and it has huge collections of libraries so we dont have write everything .

3)
what is a package?

 A package is a folder that contains multiple related Python files (called modules).Each module has different code written for a specific task.A package helps us organize code, reuse it, and share it easily with others. Instead of writing everything from scratch, we can just import a package and use the tools inside it.

Different of types of packages we have pandas, scikit-learn, flask, requests, NumPy, matplotlib and we use key word "import" to use this package.

4)
what is a flow chart?

A flowchart is a visual diagram that shows the steps in a process or program, using shapes and arrows to represent the flow of logic.
A oval it represent the start and end
Process (Rectangle)	A task or action to perform
Decision (Diamond)	A yes/no or true/false condition
Arrow	Direction of flow (next step)
 Input/Output (Parallelogram)	Get input or display result

5) what is a Operator?
Operators are special symbols or words that perform operations on variables or values, like math, comparison, logic, etc.
we have different types of operators like Arithmetic Operators – Do basic math,Comparison Operators(like ==, !=, <,>), Logical Operators (like and or and not)

6) what is loop?

A loop is a way to repeat a set of instructions again and again until a condition is met.

Main we have like for loop, while loop, for each

For loop:
✅ What it does:
Repeats a block of code a specific number of times or for each item in a list.
for i in range(1, 6):
    print("Count:", i)

while loop :
✅ What it does:
Repeats while a condition is true. You must control the condition to stop the loop.

count = 1
while count <= 5:
    print("This is number", count)
    count += 1
Starts from count = 1

Repeats until count becomes 6

Make sure to update the counter (count += 1) or it loops forever!

7) Function ?
A function is a named block of code that performs a specific task. You can call it whenever you want to perform that task again.

def function_name(parameters):
    # code block
    return result
